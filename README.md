# Final Project: Did i Stall out?

## Inroduction
  **Learning how to drive a manual is hard**
  In ways its like learning how to code, when you first start off you forget to give variables and functions asignments and you might not have a grasp on when what parts of code is being read.The same way you have to think in Object Oreinted or Functional Programing, You have to think in Manual as aposed to Automatic.
  
## Rules
+ if you make it to 5th gear, you get to the highway and you win
+ if you let off the clutch to fast you **will** stall out.
+ if you hit the brake with out the clutch you **will** stall out.
+ if you switch gears to fast going up (ex. going from 1 to 3) you get rear ended.
